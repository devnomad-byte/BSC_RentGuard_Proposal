# RentGuard: Chain-level Rent Collection & Asset Recovery for BNB Smart Chain

## Core Problems Addressed

| Problem | Current State | RentGuard Solution |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **State Bloat** | BSC full nodes approaching 1TB storage | Auto-cleanup of inactive data with unpaid rent |
| **Asset Loss** | ~$1 billion lost annually due to errors | Decentralized asset recovery mechanism |
| **Storage Management** | Lack of chain-level storage optimization | Solana-like rent model with EVM compatibility |

## Protocol Design

**Rent Collection Mechanism**
- Users pay periodic rent (0.01 BNB/month) to keep data active
- Support for prepayment to achieve "rent-exempt" status
- Implemented via BEP standard extension, network-wide

**Asset Recovery Feature**
- Self-service recovery of mistakenly sent BEP-20 tokens
- Multi-sig or DAO governance for assisted recovery
- Implementable at chain or contract level

## Technical Implementation Path

**Chain-level** (Priority)
- BEP standard extension
- PoSA consensus modification
- Network-wide node upgrade

**Contract-level** (Alternative)
- Universal smart contract
- DApp integration
- No consensus changes required

## Ecosystem Value

- **Performance Enhancement**: Reduced storage burden, targeting sub-second block times
- **User Growth**: Asset recovery features increase platform attractiveness, projected 500K new DAU in 6 months
- **TVL Growth**: Rent locking and improved user trust, estimated $20M TVL contribution
- **Ecosystem Synergy**: Collaboration with BNB Greenfield and opBNB for complete Web3 storage solution

## Competitive Advantage

- vs. Solana: Maintains EVM compatibility, adds asset recovery functionality
- vs. Ethereum: Lower Gas costs, more comprehensive storage management
- vs. Current BSC: Provides chain-level solution, no third-party dependencies

## Request

This proposal provides only the concept design, requesting the Binance team to:
1. Include RentGuard in the BSC technical roadmap
2. Implement the protocol through Binance's development team
3. Support community promotion and user education
