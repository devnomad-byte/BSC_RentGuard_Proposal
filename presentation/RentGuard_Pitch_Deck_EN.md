# RentGuard Protocol
## Chain-level Rent Collection & Asset Recovery for BSC

---

## Problem Statement

- **State Bloat**: BSC full nodes storage growing (~1TB)
- **Asset Loss**: ~$1B lost annually due to user errors
- **Storage Efficiency**: No chain-level storage management

---

## Solution: RentGuard Protocol

## Core Feature 1: Rent Collection

- Users pay rent (0.01 BNB/month) to keep data active
- Unused data automatically cleared
- "Rent-exempt" option (prepay for long-term)

## Core Feature 2: Asset Recovery

- Self-service recovery of mistakenly sent BEP-20 tokens
- Decentralized governance for assisted recovery
- High-security multi-sig verification

## Technical Implementation

**Chain-level** (Priority)
- BEP standard extension
- PoSA consensus modification
- Network-wide upgrade

**Contract-level** (Alternative)
- Universal smart contract
- DApp integration
- No consensus changes needed

## Value to BSC Ecosystem

- Enhanced Performance: sub-second block times
- Improved Reliability: reduced node failure risk
- Greater Security: asset recovery protection
- Lower Costs: predictable storage fee model
